<h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-center"> Final Paper Submission</h1>

Full registration at the author rate before October 11, 2024, is required for final manuscript submission. Each full registration can cover only ONE paper. See the <a href="https://www.buildsec.org/registration" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', color: 'blue' }}>registration page</a> for details. All accepted papers will be published in the BuildSEC proceedings and IEEE Xplore. Final papers must be submitted through EasyChair.

<h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"> Paper Revision </h2>  

The final version of accepted papers (ready for publication, camera-ready) must be formatted as the standard 2-column IEEE layout and adhere to the following requirements: 
-	Full Regular papers: A maximum of 8 pages, including references and appendices.
-	Short papers: A maximum of 4 pages plus references.
You are strongly recommended to revise your paper in consideration of the reviewers' comments. Your Track Chairs may contact you if they are not satisfied with the final version of your paper. The final paper should include the author's name, and affiliations and may acknowledge the funding/support sources. The title, the list of authors and their listing order cannot be changed after the paper is accepted. Failure to abide by this policy may remove your paper from the final conference program.

<h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"> Final Paper Formatting Instructions </h2>

--	Log in to EasyChair as you did to submit the original paper .

--	Ensure ALL paper authors are included on the author list and in the correct order.

--	Check that all paper information in EasyChair matches the information on the camera-ready PDF file. Detailed information (title, abstract, etc) that will appear in the conference proceedings will be taken from EasyChair and not from the submitted PDF file.

<h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"> IEEE copyright transfer form submission </h2>

To include your accepted paper in both the conference proceedings volume and the IEEE Xplore digital library, one of the authors must fill and sign the IEEE copyright transfer form and return it to IEEE. The IEEE copyright transfer form can be filled in online easily through EasyChair. To do so, please follow the procedure below:
-	IEEE requires that the author of every published paper sign a copyright agreement. As we add each accepted paper to the proceedings, the system will automatically send an email to each of the corresponding authors with detailed instructions on how to sign the copyright agreement through EasyChair. This form should be signed and submitted by the primary author after the camera-ready PDF is submitted.
-	Please review and update all author information in EasyChair prior to submitting the Copyright form.  The final author information for the proceedings will pull from EasyChair and not the final camera-ready paper itself.  The IEEE Copyright Form must also match the EasyChair author demographic information exactly.
-	NOTE:  By signing the IEEE copyright form, you are affirming that the material in your paper is original and you have not previously released copyright for this paper to another party.  Failure to submit the IEEE copyright form by the deadline will result in an automatic withdrawal of your paper for presentation and publication.
-	Review the detailed IEEE Copyright Policy here.

<h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"> Important notes on plagiarism </h2>
Authors are required to submit material that is original and has not been published or submitted for consideration elsewhere. Author misconduct, including fabrication of results and plagiarism of the work of others, shall be subject to sanctions by the IEEE under the rules of Member Conduct.
