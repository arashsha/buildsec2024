<h1 className="text-center">Visa Information</h1>

As BuildSEC 2024 will be held at the IIIT Delhi, India, visa requirements will depend on your nationality and current residence. You can check if you need a visa from your country (<a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', color: 'blue' }}>https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/</a>). If a visa is necessary, it is important to apply for it promptly. Visa processing times vary depending on the nationality of the applicant, the purpose of the stay and the local visa issuing conditions. It usually ranges from 15 days to 45 days, but it can sometimes take longer. An interview at a consulate may also be required. 

## Visa Support Letter

You may need to submit a visa support letter as part of your visa application process. BuildSEC is offering visa support letters to all registered attendees, authors, students, and committee members of BuildSEC 2024. These letters will be provided regardless of whether they present a paper or not, as long as they attend the event. If you require a visa support letter, please complete your registration and then send an email to registration chair Dr. Ravi Anand <a href="mailto:buildsec2024iiitd@gmail.com" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', color: 'blue' }}>buildsec2024iiitd@gmail.com</a> with the following details:

- Your name as it appears in your passport.
- Your current postal mailing address
- Your registration confirmation number
- If any papers are accepted for the conference, please provide the title, and specify whether you are the sole author or a co-author.
- Your email address
- Your institute/company as it will appear on the letter

Visa support letters are processed in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter via email within 7-10 business days. The PDF letter will be a signed electronic version of the original letter. Please print and bring the PDF visa support letter to your visa appointment. The original letter will only be mailed upon explicit request. Kindly note that registered and paid conference participants will receive visa support letters. If a participant withdraws from the conference after receiving the visa support letter, the consulate will be informed accordingly.

Please be aware that we do not issue formal letters of invitation.

Please give 10 business days to us for sending your visa support letter.

If you encounter any difficulties with the visa application process or have other concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.

We wish you the best of luck with your travel arrangements!
